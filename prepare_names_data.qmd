I have collected data from three sources:

1. https://www.acko.com/health-insurance/s/pregnancy/baby-names/modern-indian-baby-names-for-boys-and-girls-with-meanings/ - saved as `website_names.txt`
2. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jasleensondhi/indian-names-corpus-nltk-data/data - saved as `first_names.txt`
3. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meemr5/indian-names-boys-girls - saved as `indian_names.txt`

I want to read the data from the above sources, clean it, remove duplicates and save it in a file called `names.txt`

# Process website_names.txt
```{python}
with open("data/website_names.txt") as file:
    text = text = file.read().splitlines()
file.close()
#print(type(text), len(text))
# Remove empty strings from the list
text = [x for x in text if x]
text
# Remove the characters after '-'' as they are not part of the name and make all characters lowercase, and remove leading and training whitespaces
names1 = [word.split("-")[0].lower().strip() for word in text]
names1[:10], len(names1)
```

# Process first_names.txt

```{python}
with open("data/first_names.txt") as file:
    text = file.read().splitlines()
file.close()
#print(type(text), len(text))

# For all words in the list, use all lowercase letters and remove leading and trailing white spaces
names2 = [word.lower().strip() for word in text]
names2[:10], len(names2)
```

# Process indian_names.txt

```{python}
with open("data/indian_names.txt") as file:
    text = file.read().splitlines()
file.close()
len(text), text[1:10]

# For all words in the list, use all lowercase letters and remove leading and trailing white spaces
names3 = [word.lower().strip() for word in text]
names3[:10], len(names3)
```

# Combine words from all three sources, remove duplicates and save in a new file names.txt

```{python}
names = list(set(names1+names2+names3))
print(f"total length of all three lists: {len(names1)+len(names2)+len(names3)}")

print(f"Total length of combined list with duplicates removed: {len(names)}")
len(names), names[:10]
```

# Write the names to a .txt file

```{python}
with open("data/names.txt", "w") as file:
    text = "\n".join(names)
    file.write(text)
file.close()
```

# Read the data from the file to make sure it's working as expected

```{python}
with open("data/names.txt", "r") as file:
    text = file.read().splitlines()
file.close()
text[:10], len(text)
```
