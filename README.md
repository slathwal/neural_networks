The final names dataset is compiled from a few sources:
1. https://www.acko.com/health-insurance/s/pregnancy/baby-names/modern-indian-baby-names-for-boys-and-girls-with-meanings/
2. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jasleensondhi/indian-names-corpus-nltk-data/data
3. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meemr5/indian-names-boys-girls

The data from the above three sources is combined and saved in a file called `names.txt` in the data folder. The processing script is in the notebook `prepare_names_data.qmd`.
